This is my Personal Web Porfolio.

This is my first real project that I have finished using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

You may veiw it and comment anything for ways to improve it.
Thank you so much.

P.S. for the project section, if you have saw that it is not functional, that's because I'm currently starting to take programming seriously as of today(March 12,2024).
I'm currently building at least 6-10 fully furnished projects.
While also learning more about wed development and also practice performance of my websites and also learn more about other library and frameworks. Still thank you for viewing it
